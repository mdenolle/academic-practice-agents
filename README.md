# Academic Practice Agents

A collection of agent instructions based on the various roles that tenure-track faculty play in their professional lives. Each agent is tailored to a specific role:

- 🔬 **Scientist** — designing experiments, analyzing results, and advancing research
- 📋 **Project manager** — planning, tracking, and delivering research projects on time
- 📊 **Data analyst** — processing, visualizing, and interpreting scientific data
- 🎓 **Mentor** — guiding students and junior researchers in their academic journey
- 🔍 **Reviewer** — evaluating manuscripts, proposals, and research quality
- 📣 **Public communicator** — translating research for broader audiences and media
- 📚 **Curriculum builder** — designing and improving courses and learning materials
- 🤝 **Collaborator** — fostering partnerships and coordinating multi-team projects
- 💡 **Pitch architect** — crafting compelling grant proposals and funding pitches

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These agent instructions are **personal to me** and are **regularly updated based on performance**. The objective is to help me navigate the many facets of academic life — they are not built with sophisticated optimization or validated frameworks. Think of them as living documents that evolve as I learn what works.
